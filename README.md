<h3> Description:</h3> <br>

In this project i built an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects. Here i used Apple’s Core Image framework – and one important framework UIKit.

Core Image is Apple’s high-performance framework for manipulating images, and it’s extraordinarily powerful. Apples image filters providing things like blurs, color shifts, pixellation, and more, and all are optimized to take full advantage of the graphics processing unit (GPU) on iOS devices.

<br>

<h3>Frameworks: </h3>
   1. SwiftUI <br>
   2. UIKit <br>
   3. Core Image <br>
   4. CoreImage.Cifilterbuiltins <br>
   5. PhotosUI 

<br>
<h3> What I Learned:</h3> <br>
Here i learned how to work with Coreimage framework and uikit framework for filtering an image. I also learned so many filter options of those frameworks have and how to control the amount of filtering of that image.  
<br>

<br> I also learned about-
1. CIFilter and resize image, 
2. How to convert CgImage to CIImage and CIImage to UIImage.
3. How to make multiple buttons with ConfirmationDialog
4. CoOrdinator class
5. Some protocols like- NSobject, phpickercontrollerDelecate and their uses etc.
